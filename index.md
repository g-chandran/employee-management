You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/g-chandran/employee-management/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
This is the Employee - management Project

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

1. Go to the link to view the project, you can download and make changes after you have completed the git clone
2. The system add user's data and let them view their data, which can only be edited by the admin

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/g-chandran/employee-management/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
